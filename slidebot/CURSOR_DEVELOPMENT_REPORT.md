# SlideBot Development Report: Leveraging Cursor AI for Rapid Application Development

## Executive Summary

This report details the comprehensive development process of SlideBot, an AI-powered quiz generation application, built using Cursor AI as the primary development assistant. The project demonstrates how modern AI coding assistants can accelerate development from concept to deployment, achieving a production-ready application with sophisticated features including secure Azure OpenAI integration, file parsing capabilities, and modern web UI—all developed through strategic prompting and iterative refinement.

## Project Overview

**SlideBot** is a web application that automatically generates multiple-choice quizzes from uploaded PDF or PowerPoint files, featuring:
- Secure password-protected access
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- Azure OpenAI integration for intelligent quiz generation
- Modern, responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS
- Full-stack TypeScript implementation
- Production deployment on Render

## Development Timeline & Methodology

### Phase 1: Research and Conceptualization

#### Initial Prompting Strategy
The development began with exploratory prompts to understand the technical requirements:

**Key Research Prompts Used:**
- "How can I build a web app that generates quizzes from uploaded files using AI?"
- "What's the best architecture for a React frontend with Express backend that uses Azure OpenAI?"
- "How do I securely handle file uploads and parse PDF/PPTX content?"

#### Design Decisions from Research Phase
1. **Technology Stack Selection:**
   - Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (for rapid UI development)
   - Backend: Express + TypeScript (for type safety and modern JavaScript features)
   - AI Integration: Azure OpenAI (for enterprise security and data residency)
   - File Processing: pdf-parse and JSZip libraries (for reliable document parsing)

2. **Architecture Pattern:**
   - Separation of concerns with distinct client/server structure
   - RESTful API design with clear endpoints
   - Session-based authentication for simplicity
   - In-memory file processing to avoid storage concerns

### Phase 2: Core Functionality Implementation

#### AI Prompting for Code Generation

**1. Backend Development Prompts:**
```
"Create an Express TypeScript server that:
- Accepts PDF and PPTX file uploads
- Extracts text content from these files
- Sends the text to Azure OpenAI with a specific prompt
- Returns generated quiz questions as JSON"
```

This resulted in the modular backend structure with separate concerns:
- `index.ts`: Express server setup and routing
- `fileParser.ts`: Document text extraction logic
- `quizGenerator.ts`: Azure OpenAI integration

**2. AI Integration Prompt Engineering:**
The quiz generation prompt was refined through iterations:

Initial: "Generate quiz questions from this text"
↓
Refined: "Generate 5 multiple choice questions based solely on the source material"
↓
Final: Structured system + user prompt with specific JSON format requirements

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that generates educational multiple choice quizzes strictly based on the provided source material. Avoid introducing any information that is not present in the source.`;

const userPrompt = `Source material:\n"""\n${text}\n"""\n\nGenerate a quiz with 5 multiple choice questions (each with 4 options labeled A, B, C, D) based solely on the source material above. Answer format must be valid JSON array...`;
```

**3. Frontend Development Prompts:**
```
"Build a React component with:
- Drag and drop file upload using react-dropzone
- Clean, modern UI similar to ChatGPT interface
- Loading states and error handling
- Display quiz results in an organized format"
```

### Phase 3: Security and Authentication

#### Security Implementation Prompts:
```
"Add password protection to the app that:
- Requires authentication before file upload
- Uses session storage for auth state
- Has a clean login interface
- Includes logout functionality"
```

This led to:
- Simple but effective password-based authentication
- Session storage for maintaining auth state
- Dedicated Login component with error handling
- Logout functionality in the main interface

### Phase 4: UI/UX Refinement

#### Design Iteration Prompts:
```
"Improve the UI to be more professional:
- Add gradient backgrounds
- Include hover states and transitions
- Make it fully responsive
- Add visual feedback for all interactions"
```

**Key UI Decisions:**
- Tailwind CSS for rapid styling iterations
- Consistent color scheme (blue/indigo palette)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive drag-and-drop with visual feedback
- ChatGPT-inspired clean interface

### Phase 5: Deployment and Production

#### Deployment Strategy Prompts:
```
"Create deployment configuration for Render that:
- Builds both frontend and backend
- Handles environment variables securely
- Includes proper build commands
- Sets up static site hosting for React"
```

**Deployment Innovations:**
- Comprehensive deployment guide (DEPLOY_TO_RENDER.md)
- Blueprint configuration (render.yaml) for one-click deployment
- Environment variable management strategy
- Separate static/dynamic hosting approach

## Prompting Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. Progressive Refinement Pattern
Started with broad requirements and progressively refined:
- Initial: "Build a quiz generator"
- Refined: "Build a quiz generator that uses AI"
- Final: "Build a secure web app that generates quizzes from uploaded PDFs/PPTX using Azure OpenAI"

### 2. Component-Specific Prompts
Breaking down complex features into focused prompts:
- "Create just the file upload component"
- "Now add the quiz display component"
- "Integrate these components in the main App"

### 3. Error-Driven Development
Using error messages to guide next prompts:
- "I'm getting CORS errors" → Received CORS configuration
- "The JSON parsing fails" → Got robust JSON extraction logic
- "Files larger than 1MB fail" → Received file size handling

### 4. Documentation-First Approach
- "Create a README that explains how to run this locally"
- "Add deployment instructions for non-technical users"
- "Document the environment variables needed"

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: File Parsing Complexity
**Problem:** Different file formats require different parsing strategies
**Solution via Cursor:** Prompted for modular file parser with format-specific handlers

### Challenge 2: Azure OpenAI Response Parsing
